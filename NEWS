  terminating pipe.

* Fixed issue 263, bug in subscription matching.

* Fixed documentation for ZMQ_XREQ and ZMQ_XREP sockets.

Building
--------

* Added configure --with-poller option to select polling mechanism. Will
  autoselect from kqueue, epoll, devpoll, poll, and select (Mikko Koppanen).


0MQ version 3.0.1 (beta), released on 2011/08/30
================================================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed issue 207, assertion failure in zmq_connecter.cpp:48, when an
  invalid zmq_connect() string was used, or the hostname could not be
  resolved. The zmq_connect() call now returns -1 in both those cases.

* Fixed issue 240, assertion failure in pgm_socket.cpp:437.

* Fixed issue 238, assertion failure in zmq.cpp:655, when zmq_poll is
  used on an empty set, on Windows.

* Polling on Cygwin was broken - fixed.

* Fixed issue 230: SIGPIPE errors on OS/X and FreeBSD.

* Fixed issue 232: ROUTER socket doesn't set RCVMORE on identity frame.

* Fixed issue 234: assertion failure at mailbox.cpp:77 when Ctrl-C was
  used.

Building
--------

* 0MQ support for Android added (Bill Roberts, Mikko Koppanen).

0MQ version 3.0.0 (alpha), released on 2011/07/12
=================================================

New functionality
-----------------

* POSIX-compliant zmq_send and zmq_recv introduced (uses raw buffer
  instead of message object).

* ZMQ_MULTICAST_HOPS socket option added. Sets the appropriate field in
  IP headers of PGM packets.

* Subscription forwarding. Instead of filtering on consumer, the
  subscription is moved as far as possible towards the publisher and
  filtering is done there.

* ZMQ_XPUB, ZMQ_XSUB introduced. Allow to create subscription-
  forwarding-friendly intermediate devices.

* Add sockopt ZMQ_RCVTIMEO/ZMQ_SNDTIMEO. Allow to set timeout for
  blocking send/recv calls.

* A new LABEL flag was added to the wire format. The flag distinguishes
  message parts used by 0MQ (labels) from user payload message parts.

* There is a new wire format for the REQ/REP pattern. First, the empty
  bottom-of-the-stack message part is not needed any more, the LABEL
  flag is used instead. Secondly, peer IDs are 32-bit integers rather
  than 17-byte UUIDs.

* The REQ socket now drops duplicate replies.

* Outstanding requests & replies associated with a client are dropped
  when the clients dies. This is a performance optimisation.

* Introduced ZMQ_ROUTER and ZMQ_DEALER sockets. These mimic the
  functionality of ZMQ_ROUTER and ZMQ_DEALER in 0MQ/2.1.x. Guarantees
  backward compatibility for exsiting code.

* Removed dependency on OS socketpair buffer size. No more asserts in
  mailbox.cpp because of low system limit of sockepair buffer size.

API improvements
----------------

* Obsolete constants ZMQ_UPSTREAM and ZMQ_DOWNSTREAM removed. Use
  ZMQ_PUSH and ZMQ_PULL instead.

* Timeout in zmq_poll is in milliseconds instead of microseconds. This
  makes zmq_poll() compliant with POSIX poll()

* ZMQ_MCAST_LOOP removed. There's no support for multicast over
  loopback any more. Use IPC or TCP isntead.

* zmq_send/zmq_recv was renamed zmq_sendmsg/zmq_recvmsg.

* ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL and ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL_MSEC reconciled. The new option
  is named ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL and the unit is milliseconds.

* Option types changed. Most of the numeric types are now represented
  as 'int'.

* ZMQ_HWM split into ZMQ_SNDHWM and ZMQ_RCVHWM. This makes it possible
  to control message flow separately for each direction.

* ZMQ_NOBLOCK renamed ZMQ_DONTWAIT. That makes it POSIX-compliant.

Less is More
------------

* Pre-built devices and zmq_device() removed. Should be made available
  as a separate project(s).

* ZMQ_SWAP removed. Writing data to disk should be done on top of 0MQ,
  on inside it.

* C++ binding removed from the core. Now it's a separate project, same
  as any other binding.

Bug fixes
---------

* Many.

Building
--------

* Make pkg-config dependency conditional.

Distribution
------------

* Removed Debian packaging, which is now available at packages.debian.org
  or via apt-get.


Older versions
==============

* See NEWS in 2.1.x branch.
